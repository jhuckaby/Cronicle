# Subject

**What is a Subject?** An RxJS Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers. While plain Observables are unicast (each subscribed Observer owns an independent execution of the Observable), Subjects are multicast.

<span class="informal">A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers. Subjects are like EventEmitters: they maintain a registry of many listeners.</span>

**Every Subject is an Observable.** Given a Subject, you can `subscribe` to it, providing an Observer, which will start receiving values normally. From the perspective of the Observer, it cannot tell whether the Observable execution is coming from a plain unicast Observable or a Subject.

Internally to the Subject, `subscribe` does not invoke a new execution that delivers values. It simply registers the given Observer in a list of Observers, similarly to how `addListener` usually works in other libraries and languages.

**Every Subject is an Observer.** It is an object with the methods `next(v)`, `error(e)`, and `complete()`. To feed a new value to the Subject, just call `next(theValue)`, and it will be multicasted to the Observers registered to listen to the Subject.

In the example below, we have two Observers attached to a Subject, and we feed some values to the Subject:

```js
var subject = new Rx.Subject();

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

subject.next(1);
subject.next(2);
```

With the following output on the console:

```none
observerA: 1
observerB: 1
observerA: 2
observerB: 2
```

Since a Subject is an Observer, this also means you may provide a Subject as the argument to the `subscribe` of any Observable, like the example below shows:

```js
var subject = new Rx.Subject();

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

var observable = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);

observable.subscribe(subject); // You can subscribe providing a Subject
```

Which executes as:

```none
observerA: 1
observerB: 1
observerA: 2
observerB: 2
observerA: 3
observerB: 3
```

With the approach above, we essentially just converted a unicast Observable execution to multicast, through the Subject. This demonstrates how Subjects are the only way of making any Observable execution be shared to multiple Observers.

There are also a few specializations of the `Subject` type: `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, and `AsyncSubject`.

## Multicasted Observables

A "multicasted Observable" passes notifications through a Subject which may have many subscribers, whereas a plain "unicast Observable" only sends notifications to a single Observer.

<span class="informal">A multicasted Observable uses a Subject under the hood to make multiple Observers see the same Observable execution.</span>

Under the hood, this is how the `multicast` operator works: Observers subscribe to an underlying Subject, and the Subject subscribes to the source Observable. The following example is similar to the previous example which used `observable.subscribe(subject)`:

```js
var source = Rx.Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);
var subject = new Rx.Subject();
var multicasted = source.multicast(subject);

// These are, under the hood, `subject.subscribe({...})`:
multicasted.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
multicasted.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

// This is, under the hood, `source.subscribe(subject)`:
multicasted.connect();
```

`multicast` returns an Observable that looks like a normal Observable, but works like a Subject when it comes to subscribing. `multicast` returns a `ConnectableObservable`, which is simply an Observable with the `connect()` method.

The `connect()` method is important to determine exactly when the shared Observable execution  will start. Because `connect()` does `source.subscribe(subject)` under the hood, `connect()` returns a Subscription, which you can unsubscribe from in order to cancel the shared Observable execution.

### Reference counting

Calling `connect()` manually and handling the Subscription is often cumbersome. Usually, we want to *automatically* connect when the first Observer arrives, and automatically cancel the shared execution when the last Observer unsubscribes.

Consider the following example where subscriptions occur as outlined by this list:

1. First Observer subscribes to the multicasted Observable
2. **The multicasted Observable is connected**
3. The `next` value `0` is delivered to the first Observer
4. Second Observer subscribes to the multicasted Observable
5. The `next` value `1` is delivered to the first Observer
5. The `next` value `1` is delivered to the second Observer
1. First Observer unsubscribes from the multicasted Observable
5. The `next` value `2` is delivered to the second Observer
1. Second Observer unsubscribes from the multicasted Observable
1. **The connection to the multicasted Observable is unsubscribed**

To achieve that with explicit calls to `connect()`, we write the following code:

```js
var source = Rx.Observable.interval(500);
var subject = new Rx.Subject();
var multicasted = source.multicast(subject);
var subscription1, subscription2, subscriptionConnect;

subscription1 = multicasted.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});
// We should call `connect()` here, because the first
// subscriber to `multicasted` is interested in consuming values
subscriptionConnect = multicasted.connect();

setTimeout(() => {
  subscription2 = multicasted.subscribe({
    next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
  });
}, 600);

setTimeout(() => {
  subscription1.unsubscribe();
}, 1200);

// We should unsubscribe the shared Observable execution here,
// because `multicasted` would have no more subscribers after this
setTimeout(() => {
  subscription2.unsubscribe();
  subscriptionConnect.unsubscribe(); // for the shared Observable execution
}, 2000);
```

If we wish to avoid explicit calls to `connect()`, we can use ConnectableObservable's `refCount()` method (reference counting), which returns an Observable that keeps track of how many subscribers it has. When the number of subscribers increases from `0` to `1`, it will call `connect()` for us, which starts the shared execution. Only when the number of subscribers decreases from `1` to `0` will it be fully unsubscribed, stopping further execution.

<span class="informal">`refCount` makes the multicasted Observable automatically start executing when the first subscriber arrives, and stop executing when the last subscriber leaves.</span>

Below is an example:

```js
var source = Rx.Observable.interval(500);
var subject = new Rx.Subject();
var refCounted = source.multicast(subject).refCount();
var subscription1, subscription2, subscriptionConnect;

// This calls `connect()`, because
// it is the first subscriber to `refCounted`
console.log('observerA subscribed');
subscription1 = refCounted.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('observerB subscribed');
  subscription2 = refCounted.subscribe({
    next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
  });
}, 600);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('observerA unsubscribed');
  subscription1.unsubscribe();
}, 1200);

// This is when the shared Observable execution will stop, because
// `refCounted` would have no more subscribers after this
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('observerB unsubscribed');
  subscription2.unsubscribe();
}, 2000);
```

Which executes with the output:

```none
observerA subscribed
observerA: 0
observerB subscribed
observerA: 1
observerB: 1
observerA unsubscribed
observerB: 2
observerB unsubscribed
```

The `refCount()` method only exists on ConnectableObservable, and it returns an `Observable`, not another ConnectableObservable.

## BehaviorSubject

One of the variants of Subjects is the `BehaviorSubject`, which has a notion of "the current value". It stores the latest value emitted to its consumers, and whenever a new Observer subscribes, it will immediately receive the "current value" from the `BehaviorSubject`.

<span class="informal">BehaviorSubjects are useful for representing "values over time". For instance, an event stream of birthdays is a Subject, but the stream of a person's age would be a BehaviorSubject.</span>

In the following example, the BehaviorSubject is initialized with the value `0` which the first Observer receives when it subscribes. The second Observer receives the value `2` even though it subscribed after the value `2` was sent.

```js
var subject = new Rx.BehaviorSubject(0); // 0 is the initial value

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

subject.next(1);
subject.next(2);

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

subject.next(3);
```

With output:

```none
observerA: 0
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerB: 2
observerA: 3
observerB: 3
```

## ReplaySubject

A `ReplaySubject` is similar to a `BehaviorSubject` in that it can send old values to new subscribers, but it can also *record* a part of the Observable execution.

<span class="informal">A `ReplaySubject` records multiple values from the Observable execution and replays them to new subscribers.</span>

When creating a `ReplaySubject`, you can specify how many values to replay:

```js
var subject = new Rx.ReplaySubject(3); // buffer 3 values for new subscribers

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

subject.next(1);
subject.next(2);
subject.next(3);
subject.next(4);

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

subject.next(5);
```

With output:

```none
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerA: 3
observerA: 4
observerB: 2
observerB: 3
observerB: 4
observerA: 5
observerB: 5
```

You can also specify a *window time* in milliseconds, besides of the buffer size, to determine how old the recorded values can be. In the following example we use a large buffer size of `100`, but a window time parameter of just `500` milliseconds.

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
var subject = new Rx.ReplaySubject(100, 500 /* windowTime */);

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

var i = 1;
setInterval(() => subject.next(i++), 200);

setTimeout(() => {
  subject.subscribe({
    next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
  });
}, 1000);
```

With the following output where the second Observer gets events `3`, `4` and `5` that happened in the last `500` milliseconds prior to its subscription:

```none
observerA: 1
observerA: 2
observerA: 3
observerA: 4
observerA: 5
observerB: 3
observerB: 4
observerB: 5
observerA: 6
observerB: 6
...
```

## AsyncSubject

The AsyncSubject is a variant where only the last value of the Observable execution is sent to its observers, and only when the execution completes.

```js
var subject = new Rx.AsyncSubject();

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerA: ' + v)
});

subject.next(1);
subject.next(2);
subject.next(3);
subject.next(4);

subject.subscribe({
  next: (v) => console.log('observerB: ' + v)
});

subject.next(5);
subject.complete();
```

With output:

```none
observerA: 5
observerB: 5
```

The AsyncSubject is similar to the [`last()`](../class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html#instance-method-last) operator, in that it waits for the `complete` notification in order to deliver a single value.
