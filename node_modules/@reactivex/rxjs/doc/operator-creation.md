# Operator Creation

There are many ways to create an operator for RxJS. In this version of RxJS, performance was the primary consideration, as such, operator creation
in a way that adheres to the existing structures in this library may not be straight forward. This is an attempt to document how to
create an operator either for yourself, or for this library.

For how to develop a custom operator for *this* library, [see below](#advanced).

## DIY Custom Operators for End Users

### Guidelines

In the most common case, users might like to create an operator to be used only by their app. These can be developed in
any way the developer sees fit, but here are some guidelines:

1. __Operators should always return an Observable__. You're performing operations on unknown sets of things to create new sets.
  It only makes sense to return a new set. If you create a method that returns something other than an Observable, it's not an operator,
  and that's fine.
2. __Be sure to manage subscriptions__ created inside of the Observable your operator returns. Your operator is going to have to
  subscribe to the source (or `this`) inside of the returned Observable, be sure that it's returned as part of unsubscribe handler or
  subscription.
3. __Be sure to handle exceptions from passed functions__. If you're implementing an operator that takes a function as an argument,
  when you call it, you'll want to wrap it in a `try/catch` and send the error down the `error()` path on the observable.
4. __Be sure to teardown scarce resources__ in your unsubscribe handler of your returned Observable. If you're setting up event handlers
  or a web socket, or something like that, the unsubscribe handler is a great place to remove that event handler or close that socket.

### Example

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
function mySimpleOperator(someCallback) {
   // We *could* do a `var self = this;` here to close over, but see next comment
   return Observable.create(subscriber => {
     // because we're in an arrow function `this` is from the outer scope.
     var source = this;

     // save our inner subscription
     var subscription = source.subscribe(value => {
       // important: catch errors from user-provided callbacks
       try {
         subscriber.next(someCallback(value));
       } catch(err) {
         subscriber.error(err);
       }
     },
     // be sure to handle errors and completions as appropriate and
     // send them along
     err => subscriber.error(err),
     () => subscriber.complete());

     // to return now
     return subscription;
   });
}
```

### Adding the operator to Observable

There are a few ways to do this. It's really down to needs and preference:

1) Use the ES7 function bind operator (`::`) available in transpilers like [BabelJS](http://babeljs.io):

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
someObservable::mySimpleOperator(x => x + '!');
```

2) Create your own Observable subclass and override `lift` to return it:

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
class MyObservable extends Observable {
  lift(operator) {
    const observable = new MyObservable(); //<-- important part here
    observable.source = this;
    observable.operator = operator;
    return observable;
  }

  // put it here .. or ..
  customOperator() {
    /* do things and return an Observable */
  }
}

// ... put it here...
MyObservable.prototype.mySimpleOperator = mySimpleOperator;
```

3) Patch `Observable.prototype` directly:

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
Observable.prototype.mySimpleOperator = mySimpleOperator;

// ... and later .../

someObservable.mySimpleOperator(x => x + '!');
```

### Operator as a pure function

If you don't want to patch the Observable prototype, you can also write the operator as a pure function that takes the input Observable as argument, instead of relying on the `this` keyword.

Example implementation:

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
function mySimpleOperator(someCallback) {
  // notice that we return a function here
  return function mySimpleOperatorImplementation(source) {
    return Observable.create(subscriber => {
      var subscription = source.subscribe(value => {
        try {
          subscriber.next(someCallback(value));
        } catch(err) {
          subscriber.error(err);
        }
      },
      err => subscriber.error(err),
      () => subscriber.complete());

      return subscription;
   });
  }
}
```

This can now be used with the `let()` method on the Observable:

<!-- skip-example -->
```js
const obs = someObservable.let(mySimpleOperator(x => x + '!'));
```

## Publish your operator as a separate library

We strongly recommend you to publish your custom operator as an npm package as a pure function to be used with `let`. See the sections above. RxJS core already has over 100 operators, and we should not add more operators unless they are absolutely essential and add functionality not possible with existing operators.

Publishing it as a separate library will guarantee your operator to be immediately usable by the community, and we can start growing an RxJS ecosystem as opposed to making the RxJS library thicker and heavier. There are cases, however, where the new operator should be added to the core library.

## <a id="advanced"></a>Creating An Operator For Inclusion In *This* Library

**Please publish your operator as a separate library before proposing it into RxJS.** See the section above.

__To create an operator for inclusion in this library, it's probably best to work from prior art__. Something
like the `filter` operator would be a good start. It's not expected that you'll be able to read
this section and suddenly be an expert operator contributor.

**If you find yourself confused, DO NOT worry. Follow prior examples in the repo, submit a PR, and we'll work with you.**

Hopefully the information provided here will give context to decisions made while developing operators in this library.
There are a few things to know and (try to) understand while developing operators:

1. All operator methods are actually created in separate modules from `Observable`. This is so developers can
 "build their own observable" by pulling in operator methods and adding them to observable in their own module.
 It also means operators can be brought in ad-hock and used directly, either with the ES7 function bind operator
 in Babel (`::`) or by using it with `.call()`.
2. Every operator has an `Operator` class. The `Operator` class is really a `Subscriber` "factory". It's
 what gets passed into the `lift` method to make the "magic" happen. It's sole job is to create the operation's
 `Subscriber` instance on subscription.
3. Every operator has a `Subscriber` class. This class does *all* of the logic for the operation. It's job is to
 handle values being nexted in (generally by overriding `_next()`) and forward it along to the `destination`,
 which is the next observer in the chain.
   - It's important to note that the `destination` Observer set on any `Subscriber` serves as more than just
   the destinations for the events passing through, If the `destination` is a `Subscriber` it also is used to set up
   a shared underlying `Subscription`, which, in fact, is also a `Subscriber`, and is the first `Subscriber` in the
   chain.
   - Subscribers all have `add` and `remove` methods that are used for adding and removing inner subscriptions to
   the shared underlying subscription.
   - When you `subscribe` to an Observable, the functions or Observer you passed are used to create the final `destination`
   `Subscriber` for the chain. It's this `Subscriber` that is really also the shared `Subscription` for the operator chain.

### Submitting a PR for an Operator

Please complete these steps for each new operator added to RxJS as a pull request:

- Add the operator to Rx
- It must have a `-spec.ts` tests file covering the canonical corner cases, with marble diagram tests
- If possible, write a `asDiagram` test case too, for PNG diagram generation purposes
- The spec file should have a type definition test at the end of the spec to verify type definition for various use cases
- The operator must be documented in JSDoc style in the implementation file, including also the PNG marble diagram image
- The operator should be listed in `doc/operators.md` in a category of operators
- It should also be inserted in the operator decision tree file `doc/decision-tree-widget/tree.yml`
- You may need to update `MIGRATION.md` if the operator differs from the corresponding one in RxJS v4

### Inner Subscriptions

An "inner subscriber" or "inner subscription" is any subscription created inside of an operator's primary Subscriber. For example,
if you were to create your own "merge" operator of some sort, the Observables that are arriving on the source observable that you
want to "merge" will need to be subscribed to. Those subscriptions will be inner subscriptions. One interesting thing about
inner subscriptions in this library is that if you pass and set a `destination` on them, they will try to use that destination
for their `unsubscribe` calls. Meaning if you call `unsubscribe` on them, it might not do anything. As such, it's usually desireable
not to set the `destination` of inner subscriptions. An example of this might be the switch operators, that have a single underlying
inner subscription that needs to unsubscribe independent of the main subscription.

If you find yourself creating inner subscriptions, it might also be worth checking to see if the observable being passed `_isScalar`,
because if it is, you can pull the `value` out of it directly and improve the performance of your operator when it's operating over
scalar observables. For reference a scalar observable is any observable that has a single static value underneath it. `Observable.of('foo')` will
return a `ScalarObservable`, likewise, resolved `PromiseObservable`s will act as scalars.
