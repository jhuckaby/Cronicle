## v3.0.0 2017-01-31

* Initial version of Nodemailer 3

This update brings a lot of breaking changes:

* License changed from MIT to **EUPL-1.1**. This was possible as the new version of Nodemailer is a major rewrite. The features I don't have ownership for, were removed or reimplemented. If there's still some snippets in the code that have vague ownership then notify <mailto:andris@kreata.ee> about the conflicting code and I'll fix it.
* Requires **Node.js v6+**
* All **templating is gone**. It was too confusing to use and to be really universal a huge list of different renderers would be required. Nodemailer is about email, not about parsing different template syntaxes
* **No NTLM authentication**. It was too difficult to re-implement. If you still need it then it would be possible to introduce a pluggable SASL interface where you could load the NTLM module in your own code and pass it to Nodemailer. Currently this is not possible.
* **OAuth2 authentication** is built in and has a different [configuration](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/). You can use both user (3LO) and service (2LO) accounts to generate access tokens from Nodemailer. Additionally there's a new feature to authenticate differently for every message â€“ useful if your application sends on behalf of different users instead of a single sender.
* **Improved Calendaring**. Provide an ical file to Nodemailer to send out [calendar events](https://nodemailer.com/message/calendar-events/).

And also some non-breaking changes:

* All **dependencies were dropped**. There is exactly 0 dependencies needed to use Nodemailer. This brings the installation time of Nodemailer from NPM down to less than 2 seconds
* **Delivery status notifications** added to Nodemailer
* Improved and built-in **DKIM** signing of messages. Previously you needed an external module for this and it did quite a lousy job with larger messages
* **Stream transport** to return a RFC822 formatted message as a stream. Useful if you want to use Nodemailer as a preprocessor and not for actual delivery.
* **Sendmail** transport built-in, no need for external transport plugin

See [Nodemailer.com](https://nodemailer.com/) for full documentation

## 2.6.0 2016-09-05

* Added new options disableFileAccess and disableUrlAccess
* Fixed envelope handling where cc/bcc fields were ignored in the envelope object

## 2.4.2 2016-05-25

* Added new message option `textEncoding`. If `textEncoding` is not set then detect best encoding automatically
* Added new message option `icalEvent` to embed iCalendar events. Example [here](examples/ical-event.js)
* Added new attachment option `raw` to use prepared MIME contents instead of generating a new one. This might be useful when you want to handcraft some parts of the message yourself, for example if you want to inject a PGP encrypted message as the contents of a MIME node
* Added new message option `raw` to use an existing MIME message instead of generating a new one

## 2.1.0 2016-02-01

Republishing 2.1.0-rc.1 as stable. To recap, here's the notable changes between v2.0 and v2.1:
