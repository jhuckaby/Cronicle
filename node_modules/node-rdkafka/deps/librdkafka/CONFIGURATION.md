An application can either query this value or attempt to set it with its list of required features to check for library support. <br>*Type: CSV flags*
client.id                                |  *  |                 |       rdkafka | Client identifier. <br>*Type: string*

api.version.request                      |  *  | true, false     |          true | Request broker's supported API versions to adjust functionality to available protocol features. If set to false, or the ApiVersionRequest fails, the fallback version `broker.version.fallback` will be used. **NOTE**: Depends on broker version >=0.10.0. If the request is not supported by (an older) broker the `broker.version.fallback` fallback is used. <br>*Type: boolean*

broker.version.fallback                  |  *  |                 |         0.9.0 | Older broker versions (<0.10.0) provides no way for a client to query for supported protocol features (ApiVersionRequest, see `api.version.request`) making it impossible for the client to know what features it may use. As a workaround a user may set this property to the expected broker version and the client will automatically adjust its feature set accordingly if the ApiVersionRequest fails (or is disabled). The fallback broker version will be used for `api.version.fallback.ms`. Valid values are: 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1, 0.8.0. Any other value, such as 0.10.2.1, enables ApiVersionRequests. <br>*Type: string*

Property                                 | C/P | Range           |       Default | Description

request.required.acks                    |  P  | -1 .. 1000      |             1 | This field indicates how many acknowledgements the leader broker must receive from ISR brokers before responding to the request: *0*=Broker does not send any response/ack to client, *1*=Only the leader broker will need to ack the message, *-1* or *all*=broker will block until message is committed by all in sync replicas (ISRs) or broker's `in.sync.replicas` setting before sending response.  <br>*Type: integer*
acks                                     |  P  |                 |               | Alias for `request.required.acks`
request.timeout.ms                       |  P  | 1 .. 900000     |          5000 | The ack timeout of the producer request in milliseconds. This value is only enforced by the broker and relies on `request.required.acks` being != 0. <br>*Type: integer*
message.timeout.ms                       |  P  | 0 .. 900000     |        300000 | Local message timeout. This value is only enforced locally and limits the time a produced message waits for successful delivery. A time of 0 is infinite. <br>*Type: integer*
produce.offset.report                    |  P  | true, false     |         false | Report offset of produced message back to application. The application must be use the `dr_msg_cb` to retrieve the offset from `rd_kafka_message_t.offset`. <br>*Type: boolean*
partitioner_cb                           |  P  |                 |               | Partitioner callback (set with rd_kafka_topic_conf_set_partitioner_cb()) <br>*Type: pointer*

This committed offset will be used when the process restarts to pick up where it left off. If false, the application will have to call `rd_kafka_offset_store()` to store an offset (optional). **NOTE:** This property should only be used with the simple legacy consumer, when using the high-level KafkaConsumer the global `enable.auto.commit` property must be used instead. **NOTE:** There is currently no zookeeper integration, offsets will be written to broker or local file according to offset.store.method. <br>*Type: boolean*
enable.auto.commit                       |  C  |                 |               | Alias for `auto.commit.enable`

offset.store.sync.interval.ms            |  C  | -1 .. 86400000  |            -1 | fsync() interval for the offset file, in milliseconds. Use -1 to disable syncing, and 0 for immediate sync after each write. <br>*Type: integer*
offset.store.method                      |  C  | file, broker    |        broker | Offset commit store method: 'file' - local file store (offset.store.path, et.al), 'broker' - broker commit store (requires "group.id" to be configured and Apache Kafka 0.8.2 or later on the broker.). <br>*Type: enum value*
consume.callback.max.messages            |  C  | 0 .. 1000000    |             0 | Maximum number of messages to dispatch in one `rd_kafka_consume_callback*()` call (0 = unlimited) <br>*Type: integer*
